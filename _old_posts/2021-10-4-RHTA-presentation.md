title: R for HTA showcase
---

<p align="justify">I was recently invited to present at the <a href="https://r-hta.org/events/workshop/2021/">2021 R for Health Technology Assessment (R-HTA)</a> showcase. I talked about the importance of marginalization in HTA and proposed a simple method for this purpose.</p>  
  
<p align="justify">In a nutshell, the treatment coefficient of a multivariable regression of outcome on treatment and covariates often informs average effectiveness in HTA. However, this has a conditional interpretation, as opposed to the population-level interpretation that is required for reimbursement decisions made by HTA bodies.</p>
  
<p align="justify">The presentation addresses a specific scenario, involving the marginalization of covariate-adjusted treatment effects in pairwise indirect treatment comparisons. In this case, marginalization over the target covariate distribution is required for compatible comparisons that avoid bias.</p>   
  
<p align="justify">The slides are available <a href="https://r-hta.org/events/workshop/2021/remiro-azocar.pdf">here</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkmGTBNnoRg">Youtube link</a>.</p>
    
<p align="justify">For more details on the dangers of combining incompatible effect estimates in indirect
treatment comparisons, see my <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1511">paper</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14800">arXiv</a>). For how to address this issue using marginalization, see my papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12208">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05951">here</a>.</p>
