### Bio

<p align="justify">I am a Lead Medical Affairs Statistician at <a href="https://pharma.bayer.com/">Bayer Pharmaceuticals</a>. I have ample experience acting as a statistician, researcher and statistical consultant, providing support to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare consultancy sectors.</p>
  
<p align="justify">Previously (2018-2021), I conducted doctoral research at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/">Department of Statistics, University College London</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/">Professor Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Professor Anna Heath</a> in the <a href="https://egon.stats.ucl.ac.uk/research/statistics-health-economics/">Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation</a> research group.</p> 
  
<p align="justify">During this time, I directed and performed quantitative research for <a href="https://soranalytics.com/">SORA Ltd</a>, a boutique research consultancy specialized in evidence synthesis, health technology assessment, and outcomes research. I also provided statistical support to contract research organizations such as <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> and <a href="https://www.iconplc.com/">ICON plc</a>, and to public bodies such as <a href="https://www.sickkids.ca/">SickKids</a>. Projects included the development of methodological guidelines, the statistical analysis of outcome data within a variety of programming languages, and the submission of evidence dossiers to health technology assessment agencies. I played a vital role in the success of these submissions by constructing a sound and well-supported statistical case.</p> 
  
<p align="justify">Prior to this, I completed master's degrees in <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/">Machine Learning</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/financial-computing-mres-mphil-phd">Financial Computing</a> (2018) within the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science, University College London</a>. I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a> (2016).</p>

I have taught statistics modules and workshops at the London School of Economics and University College London. 
 
### Research

<p align="justify">My research lies on the interface between statistics and health technology assessment, involving both methodological and applied problems. My primary interest is concerned with the development of statistical methodology to compare treatments in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. More specifically, I am interested in adjusting for differences in patient populations and in overcoming limited access to patient-level data.</p> 
  
<i>Themes: biostatistics, applied statistics, evidence synthesis, health technology assessment</i>
